# University Management Appplication
***

This is the git repo for the project I created as a part of assessment for *DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Lab, 4th Semester, 2017.*

The technlogies used are - 
* flask - Backend Microframework in Python
* flask_pymongo - MongoDB client
* MLab - Free online MongoDB Sandbox
* Bootstrap - Frontend Framework

I would like to thank my friend [Nikhil Kumar](https://www.facebook.com/nikhilksingh97) for sharing his knowledge of Python with me. 

Currently, there are only 15 entries in the database - and user can make queries based on student's full name, or on the basis of the CGPA (which I personally do not like).

Suggestions and bug reports are welcome!
